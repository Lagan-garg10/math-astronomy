        <h3>The universal language
            Mathematics provide a precise and universal framework for describing the universe
            It bridges cultural and linguistic gaps making it the foundation of scientific exploration
        Historical Significance
            Ancient civilization like the Babylonians and Greeks used geometry and arithmetic chart stars, predict ellipses and develop calendars
        Modern Applications
            Complex equation model planetary orbits, predict comet paths and simulate galaxy formations
            Advanced mathematical techniques help astronomers process vast amounts of data from telescopes and satellites
        Connecting Scales
            Math connects the smallest particles such as quantum phenomena to the largest structures in the universe like galaxies and dark matter

        <h3>Light Year
            The distance light travels in one year is about 9.46 trillion kilometers
            Used to measure vast distances between stars and galaxies
        Astronomical Unit (AU)
            Used for measuring distance within solar system
        Parallax Method
            A technique to measure distance to nearby star by observing their apparent shift against a distant background from two vantage points

        <h3>Law1:
            Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun as a focus
            
            Law2:
             A planet covers the same area of space in the same amount of time
             no matter where it is in its orbit

        <h3>Orbital Mechanics
            The orbits of earth, moon and sun is calculated using kepler’s laws of planetary motion
        Alignment prediction
            Eclipses occur when these celestial bodies align. Math determines the timing and position of these alignments using geometry and trigonometry
        Periodic patterns
            The saros cycle is calculated to predict recurring eclipses by analyzing lunar and solar orbits
        Exact timing and location
            Calculus and spherical geometry pinpoint when and where an eclipse will be visible on earth
